PyGame of Life 
===========
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/rubenspgcavalcante/pygameoflife.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/rubenspgcavalcante/pygameoflife)

##About

This game is based in the 'Game of Life' or simply 'Life' proposed by John Conway in a scientific [article](http://ddi.cs.uni-potsdam.de/HyFISCH/Produzieren/lis_projekt/proj_gamelife/ConwayScientificAmerican.htm) in 1970.  
It's a celular automaton wich follows a few rules

###The Rules

*    For a space that is 'populated':
    *    Each cell with one or no neighbors dies, as if by loneliness. 
    *    Each cell with four or more neighbors dies, as if by overpopulation. 
    *    Each cell with two or three neighbors survives.  
  
*    For a space that is 'empty' or 'unpopulated'
    *   Each cell with three neighbors becomes populated.
